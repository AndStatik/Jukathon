    This is my solo project in which I developed a smartphone app using React Native. It loads all sounds from a device (after asking for permission) and then a user can play audio of their liking.
    <br />

## Installation:

Follow these steps to try out the project locally:

```
npm start
```
Use an Android/iOS emulator or your smartphone to install the Expo Go app and scan the QR code from the localhost link provided from the 'npm start'
